# Student Budget Tracker Web App

This is a team project for a Software Development Course at SFU. This project was built using an Agile development cycle, split between 4 sprints over 2 months. The project is a Student Budget Tracker Web app, built using the Java Spring Framework for the backend. The project allows users to see calculate the projected cost of their undergraduate degrees, including expenses that may only apply to students to set it apart from other web-based budget calculators. The app is specially tailored for SFU students, allowing them to upload a single semester's tuition receipt to receive a full cost projection. The system offers suggestions on areas of saving based on provincial averages and allows users to log in and save these results or download them as a CSV file.
